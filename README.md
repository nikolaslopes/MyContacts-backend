  <h1><strong>	🔥 MyContacts Express 🔥 </strong></h1>
</div>
  <p> My API to list categories and users, with the possibility to create, list, update and delete both. </p> 
<br>
 <h1><strong>	About the project </strong></h1>
  
  This API was made with Express.js, and I used the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test the CRUD system. The most cool about all of this is that 
    I don't use mocks to create the users. I created the Data Base usigin the [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) , so that makes the aplication more sophisticated and 
    useful. Futhermore, to use Postgres I installed the wonderful [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to consuming API and create the Data Base. How it is a Back-end project, you
    can see the code and who knows give a git clone and test yourself!
